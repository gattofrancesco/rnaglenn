# RNA-Glenn

RNA-Glenn is a pipeline for trimming and aligning RNA sequencing data.

## Usage

Copy the entire rnaglenn folder to your home directory on Glenn and then execute the following commands:

```
$ cd rnaglenn
$ ./setup_rnaseq_pipeline_env.sh
```

This will set up a virtual environment where dependencies will be
installed.

Follow the instructions that the `setup_rnaseq_pipeline_env.sh` script
prints.
